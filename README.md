## Projects Planned for 2027
- [ ] Portfolio
  Using Next.js and react. Probably hosted or Linode

- [ ] My Operating System
  For now, just the basics like the bootloader and basic interaction. I'll resume the project later.

- [ ] Compiler of my Language
  Using VM that executes bytecode. Just a learning toy.

## Other Projects Planned
- [ ] Blue Archive Inspired Arch Linux Distribution
  Using my custom quickshell widgets, AI app and such. Probably will be hyprland. I'll implement an ai assistant to mimic arona (with animations and all)
- [ ] LLM/AI developper playground
  Using rust+tauri+ react(?), you will be able to use most API key providers, or use your own local LLM. you can change system prompt, edit messages, settings, basically you'll have a lot of control. I will also add convenient features such as memory/projects/library for any image generating models. Will support multiple providers.
